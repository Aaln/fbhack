My hack for Facebook's NYC 2013 Hackathon. Paste the code into Firefox's web console on facebook.com and see the magic happen.

Autochat.js initializes a coversation with all of your facebook friends onk

Edit:
	
	Due to Facebook fixing a bug with simulating 'enter' on Firefox, the code only open all chat windows of every friend online and inputs specified text.
